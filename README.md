### React Fundamentals Used
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Each UI section is built as a reusable component.
- **Context API**: Used for managing the cart and wishlist state globally.
- **useState and useEffect Hooks**: For managing state and side effects.
- **useLocation Hook**: Dynamically changes the background color based on the route.
- **useNavigate Hook**: Smooth navigation and modal-based actions.
- **React Router**: For managing routes and nested layouts.

### Data Handling
